# json-recipe-generator
Click generate and select a file to read recipe code from. Enter your mod id. The program will now create basic JSON files for all recipes in that file. The program currently works with only one file at a time. Some JSON files may require tweaking. This is still WIP and just something meant for me to make my life easier that I thought I would share.
